# TKO Workshop Guides 

Before or after attending each TKO workshop, participants may use the guide here 
to preview or review the content of the workshop. Previewing a workshop guide here 
will make the performing of the tasks in the workshop more quickly and smoothly. 
Reviewing a workshop guide will reinforce the technologies just learned at the workshop.

Each workshop guide is independent of each other and may be viewed in any order you like.


The TKO guides here may be used as a reference that is available anytime, 
while the workshop content is only available during the actual workshop.
